This the manual for our App.

First of all, when you are on the MainActivity, you have two possibilities:
    - Sign In, that means create an account (go to SignInActivity and fill out a form with your Surname, Name, Email and Password),
    - or Log In, if you already have an account (go to CalendarActivity2).


Then you have the CalendarActivity2 which is composed of two fragments CalendarTab and EventTab.
    - On the first tab, you can see you own calendar with different events. You have four buttons:
        - two are used to go to the next or the previous month of your calendar,
        - one is used to create a new Event (go to EventActivity and fill out a form with Name, Location, Description, StartDate and EndDate),
        - one is used to go to MyGroup (see the different group that you are part of).
        - Also if you clicked on a day with events, then you can see the list of those events at the bottom of the page.
    - The other tab is used to display all the events that are in your calendar.

When you go to the GroupPageActivity, you can see the list of all the group that you created and also the group you are part of.
    - You have a button for each group that allows you to access to the chat of this group.
    - You have a button to create a new Group (go to GroupActivity and fill out a form with Name, Description)
    - And you have a button to go back to your calendar.
